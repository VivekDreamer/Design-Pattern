You have a loan on which interest rate is subject to change and when it changes,
Loan notifies to newspaper or internet media to display a new interest rate.

//Advantage of Observer pattern
Loose coupling between objects called observer and observable.
The Subject only knows the list of observers. It don't care about how they are implemented.
All the Observers are notified by subject in a single event call as broadcast communication.

//Disadvantage 
sometimes if any problem came, debugging become little bit challenging, cuz flow of control is
implicitly between observers and observable we can predict that now, observer is going to fire
and if there is a chain of observers then, debugging become more complex.

Another issue is memory management cuz, subject will hold all the reference of all the observers
if we not unregister the object then, it can create memory issue.
